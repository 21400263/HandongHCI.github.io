## Data Visualization (SIT42001) - Introduction

### Course Introduction
In this course, students will learn and practice how to effectively visualize data and information based on design principles by using computer and design techniques.

There are three major learning topics in this course.
1. Learning **R + Shiny programming** for interactive data visualization (taught by Prof. Hyebong Choi).
2. Learning **user-friendly visualization and design principles** (taught by Prof. Wonsup Lee).
3. Doing **a data/information visualization project** (majorly led by Prof. Lee).

### Assignments (15%)
Here are three assginment topics (3% each).

Instructions
- About data
	- Get any data from the internet. You should put the reference of the source.
	- or You can artificially make any data for the assignments, in this case leave your remark that "the data has been artificially produced".
	- Any data types (e.g., .cvs, .xml, .json) are available for assignments 3 to 5.
- Drawing charts
	- Draw the following charts using **Google Chart** by the mentioned due dates.
	- Assignments
		1. Bar Chart (due: week 5)
		2. Line Chart (due: week 7)
		3. Pie Chart or Donut Chart (due: week 10; **requirement: read data from file (.csv)**)
		4. Geo Chart (due: week 13; **requirement: read data from file (.csv)**)
		5. Maps (due: week 15; **requirement: read data from file (.csv)**)
	- Considering the user-centered design principles
	- Due dates will be reannounced if it is changed.
	- Evaluation criteria
		1. Usability: 직관적인가?, 내용을 이해하기 쉬운가?, 눈에 들어오는가
		1. Data의 특성에 적합한 종류의 chart인가
- Submission of the assiengments
	- First, Create a new repository in your GitHub or make a folder in your existing Git repository.
	- Upload your html file (the filename should start with the type of chart, e.g., bar_chart_홍길동.html).
	- Submit the link of the html file (web address) in the LMS.
