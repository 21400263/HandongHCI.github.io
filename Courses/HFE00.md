## Human Factors and Ergonomics (SIT22008) - Syllabus

### Course Introduction
This course will provide essential knowledge related to the physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics of the human, also hands-on practices regarding measuring, analysis, and application of those human characteristics in product design.

This course consists of 24 classes (= 12 weeks), not 32 classes (= 16 weeks). There will be two introductory classes (= 1 week), 22 classes (= 11 weeks) of practice/project/discussion (PPD) sessions, then the course will end at around 12th or 13th week. The remaining 8 classes (= 4 weeks) will be given as online lectures that parallelly go with the course schedule.

##### PPD sessions
The PPD (Practice, Project, and Discussion) session is the essential concept of this course. Every week, students MUST take assigned online lectures (about 75 minutes lengths per week) and write an essay before they come to the class. In class, students will learn specific theories by practicing and discussing in groups. Also, students will participate in one project through the full course schedule (more or less three months), and they will make certain progress of the project during each regular class time. The activities regarding the project that are not completed in the class time should be done as the homework.

##### Online lectures
Total of 600 min (75 min x 8 classes) amount of videos will be provided through the LMS system (lms.handong.edu).

#### Course Objectives
Upon completion of the course, students will
- understand of physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics of human;
- know how to measure human characteristics and analyze it;
- experience how to apply measured/analyzed human characteristics in product design through in-class practices/discussion and team project;
- and consider the usability and human-centered design which can help a broad range of people including children, elderly, disabled, and other minorities.

#### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to
- find user-unfriendly designs around us and have feasible ideas on how to resolve or revise it to help people and society healthy and sound;
- explain how human physical, cognitive, emotional characteristics can be applied in ergonomic/human-friendly product design and development;
- discuss practical issues on how human-centric values can be considered in the product development process;
- and have broader views such as team working, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical issues that should be considered in the ergonomic and human-friendly product development.

#### Assignments and Exams
- Individual assignments: 10 essay writings
- Group assignments: progress reports for the team project
- Examination
	- Mid-term exam (around W5 and W6)
	- Final-term exam (around W12 and W13)
	- Both mid-term and final-term exams are the essay-styled take-home exam with about 7+ days period.

### Teaching Philosophy

#### Role of Professor
To say about the knowledge, there are different types: (1) information as common knowledge, (2) knowledge earned by understanding, (3) **empirical knowledge gained by experience**, (4) skills, (5) meta-knowledge, et cetera. The information or common knowledge that are a lot shared and distributed through various internet media such as blogs, news, and YouTube are not focused to care in this course. Re-providing that easily-foundable knowledge in a classroom is not meaningful as high-level education in the university. Also, delivering a huge amount of information (even that is necessary for the coursework) by a lecturer in the small classroom is almost impossible as well as an inefficient way of information delivery. Instead, earning **in-depth and empirical knowledge (by hands-on experiences through discussion, practice, writing, and projects)** that cannot be easily acquired from the internet media should be majorly offered by professional tutoring in the classroom.

The role of the professor in this course is a **facilitator** or **tutor**, not just a lecturer. As the **facilitator**, I guide students to know what to see and where to find any necessary knowledge about the course contents. I spend a lot of hours to carefully select 600 minutes of essential YouTube videos (and other media sources) that are informative, visually well-made, delivering meaningful knowledge, appropriate in the level of knowledge depth, and interesting not that boring. My role is to give meaningful questions that can be solved through critical, creative, and collaborative thinking, also to provide good reference information to expand students' knowledge and understanding. Then, during class time, I will guide students to earn sufficient experient by discussion, practice, project activities, and other hands-on experiences. As a **tutor**, I'd like to know each of my student in person through various channels so that I sincerely hope to communicate with each of them to make his/her study successfully finished through the semester.

#### Role of Students
All the activities in the classroom will be conducted by teams. Therefore, individual activity in the classroom is not appropriate, and students will be requested to actively participate in a group. Therefore, **active, positive, collaborative and enthusiastic mindsets** as a learner are highly required. Students **MUST take online lectures (about 60-75 minutes lengths) and write an essay assignment before they come to class**. Please do not hesitate to ask and discuss anything that you've wanted to know. The participation of each student will be evaluated by the professor.

This course requires students to submit **multiple essay writings** including mid- and final-terms exams. Please describe your **own thoughts, insights, and philosophy** about issues related to this course. Use your academic knowledge and personal experiences to explain. The essay writings will not be that easy to produce but it requires students to **squeeze their brain and percolate ideas to melt all the related knowledge into short sentences**. Therefore, if necessary, enjoy to **learn yourself** from anywhere (from internet media, from classmates, or from the professor) to write your opinion about the topic. Writing should reveal the author's efforts of thinking and their time spent for the writing, therefore I can so easily see those efforts by reading the article. I encourage you to have enough time to prepare own article earnestly.

In team projects, students have the **responsibility to actively participate in their team activities**. For the presentations, show fruitful outcomes of own projects as professionally as possible with well-prepared materials.

Finally, as my educational duty, I've gladly spent lots of time to **see each student of my class in person**. Please come to me **at least once during the semester**. To effectively excel my education into the class, this individual meeting is **compulsory for all student**.

#### Philosophy of essay writing
- The essay writing is aimed to help students to have clear understandings and ideas regarding human factors and ergonomics topics delivered through the course.
- The essay is NOT a report or a summary of knowledge. The essay, just like a diary, is to **express students' thoughts, ideas, opinions, arguments, discussion, agreements, or critiques** in non-strict writing styles or formats. There's NO answer for the essay topics, but essays will be evaluated by the professor in terms of such as **clarity of opinion, rationality of argument, creativity about new ideas, depth of own philosophy about the topic, and so forth**.
- For your understanding about my education philosophy on the essay writing, I share this [세바시 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYt1-Z12K2E), which is spoken in Korean. Note that I will not use the peer evaluation concept introduced in this video.

#### Grading
I personally have a disagreeing opinion of the ABCDF-based grading system. 0-to-100 scale will be more meaningful, instead. Though, personal efforts in the class and what they earned by each of the various students' activities (e.g., team projects, discussion, practices, essay writings, online lectures, exams, et cetera) will be evaluated anyhow, but the final score or the grade is not the most suitable criteria that well explain students' learning levels. I hope, therefore, students carefully think themselves about which knowledge they have earned for the future career and about how they participated in the course, instead of focusing to their score or grade that they will get as the results.

Attendance is the right of students as they paid for their learning, not a responsibility that could be evaluated; therefore, there is no evaluation of students' attendance. However, uninformed absences or late attendances will be reflected in participation criteria (10%) because the active participation in class is one of the highly required attitudes in this course.

#### Grading Scheme Overview
- Participation (10%)
- Essay assignment (20%; 10 essays)
- Mid-term examination (15%; 10-page essay style)
- Final examiination (15%; 10-page essay style)
- Project (40%)
	- Progress (20%)
	- Effort (5%)
	- Final report (5%)
	- Mid-term presentation (5%)
	- Final presentation (5%)
