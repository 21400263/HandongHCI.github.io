### Topics

#### Topic 1. [The First Essay]
Write the first essay including the follow subtopics.
- **Subtopic 1. Introduction to yourself**: Say something about yourself. What do you study in Handong? Why do you want to take this course? What do you expect to learn from this course? Is there anything that you'd like to say to the professor?
- **Subtopic 2. What is the 'human factors and ergonomics'?**: What do you know about HF/E? What could be core values of HF/E? Find one or two examples of ergonomic product and explain why that provides ergonomic values and how?

#### Topic 2. [Physical Ergonomics I: Biomechanics]
Watch the [videos listed in **2-1. Physical Ergonomics I**](HFE02_1.md), then write the essay including the following subtopics.
- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos.
- **Subtopic 2**: How can the knowledge of biomechanics help people in their daily life? Self-search some existing products for your understanding (example of search keywords: motion capture, bionics, exoskeleton, occupational biomechanics, sports science).
- **Subtopic 3**: Provide some ideas about a new product that uses human biomechanical data for general or specific people.

#### Topic 3. [Physical Ergonomics II: Anthropometry, Ergonomics at Workplace, Virtual Ergonomics]
Watch the [videos listed in **2-2. Physical Ergonomics II**](HFE02_2.md), then write the essay including the following subtopics.
- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos.
- **Subtopic 2**: How can the knowledge of anthropometry help people in their daily life? Self-search some existing products for your understanding (example of search keywords: anthropometric design, 3d body scanning, 3d human shape, human body size, office ergonomics, ergonomic posture, office stretching, digital human model).
- **Subtopic 3**: Provide some ideas about a new product that can make people in good and safe posture (at industry/office workplaces or at school/study places).

#### Topic 4. [Cognitive Ergonomics I: Information Processing Model]
Watch the [videos listed in **3-1. Cognitive Ergonomics I**](HFE03_1.md), then write the essay including the following subtopics.
- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos.
- **Subtopic 2**: Explain the process of OOO (e.g., learning, taking an exam, decision making, playing basketball) by the IPM. For the OOO task you choose, how the information is processed **within as well as between** the sensory memory, the short-term memory (= working memory), and the long-term memory? Drawing of the IPM chart might help you to understand the process of OOO. Self-search to understand the concept of IPM (example of search keywords: information processing model, information processing theory, cognitive process model, sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory).
- **Subtopic 3**: Provide some ideas on how to increase brain performance such as accurate divided attention, good memorizing, fast memorizing and recall, accurate sensation and perception, fast calculation, and so forth.

#### Topic 5. [Cognitive Ergonomics II: Fight or Flight Response, Human Error, Cognitive Training]
Watch the [videos listed in **3-2 Cognitive Ergonomics II**](HFE03_2.md), then write the essay including the following subtopics.
- **Subtopic 1. Summary**: Summarize what you've learned from the videos.
- **Subtopic 2**: How can knowledge about 'fight or flight response' (= change of human physiological status by cognitive activities) help people in their daily life? Self-search some existing products measure human bio-signals to understand the physical, cognitive, and emotional status of people (example of search keywords: ECG, EEG, eye tracking, body temperature, skin conductance).
- **Subtopic 3**: Look around. What kind of product or software can you find, which makes people causing the human error (e.g., wrong decision making, wrong perception, wrong calculation, mistake, slip, failure, memory lapse, ...). And provide some ideas on how to fix it to reduce human errors.
